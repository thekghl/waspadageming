  "description": "Initial proposal document outlining the change",
  "instruction": "Create the proposal document that establishes WHY this change is needed.\n\nSections:\n- **Why**: 1-2 sentences on the problem or opportunity. What problem does this solve? Why now?\n- **What Changes**: Bullet list of changes. Be specific about new capabilities, modifications, or removals. Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**.\n- **Capabilities**: Identify which specs will be created or modified:\n  - **New Capabilities**: List capabilities being introduced. Each becomes a new `specs/<name>/spec.md`. Use kebab-case names (e.g., `user-auth`, `data-export`).\n  - **Modified Capabilities**: List existing capabilities whose REQUIREMENTS are changing. Only include if spec-level behavior changes (not just implementation details). Each needs a delta spec file. Check `openspec/specs/` for existing spec names. Leave empty if no requirement changes.\n- **Impact**: Affected code, APIs, dependencies, or systems.\n\nIMPORTANT: The Capabilities section is critical. It creates the contract between\nproposal and specs phases. Research existing specs before filling this in.\nEach capability listed here will need a corresponding spec file.\n\nKeep it concise (1-2 pages). Focus on the \"why\" not the \"how\" -\nimplementation details belong in design.md.\n\nThis is the foundation - specs, design, and tasks all build on this.\n",
