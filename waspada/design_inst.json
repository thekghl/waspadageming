  "instruction": "Create the design document that explains HOW to implement the change.\n\nWhen to include design.md (create only if any apply):\n- Cross-cutting change (multiple services/modules) or new architectural pattern\n- New external dependency or significant data model changes\n- Security, performance, or migration complexity\n- Ambiguity that benefits from technical decisions before coding\n\nSections:\n- **Context**: Background, current state, constraints, stakeholders\n- **Goals / Non-Goals**: What this design achieves and explicitly excludes\n- **Decisions**: Key technical choices with rationale (why X over Y?). Include alternatives considered for each decision.\n- **Risks / Trade-offs**: Known limitations, things that could go wrong. Format: [Risk] ΓåÆ Mitigation\n- **Migration Plan**: Steps to deploy, rollback strategy (if applicable)\n- **Open Questions**: Outstanding decisions or unknowns to resolve\n\nFocus on architecture and approach, not line-by-line implementation.\nReference the proposal for motivation and specs for requirements.\n\nGood design docs explain the \"why\" behind technical decisions.\n",
